# BangaloreBytes (Maximizing profits, minimizing costs: The BangaloreBytes advantage for delivery businesses)

## Overview:
Create a RL based model for delivery startups to optimize the delivery system with dynamic parameter. The goal here is to delivery all the orders with minimum fuel consumption using minimum number of riders to deliver it at the promised time.

This problem first observed when me and my friend ordered the same food from a same restaurant at same time but from different accounts. Both the orders where delivered by 2 separate riders and on different time. This problem occurred many time and with different platforms as well that showcase the lack of optimum management in the rider scheduling problem in such companies.

The primary goal in delivery services is to deliver on time so we have to optimize the process without exceeding the time limit. We will be targeting efficient delivery within 50 minutes using least number of riders to deliver the orders and in a way that can save maximum fuel

## Data:
For dataset we have to gather a lot of orders data and riders informations as well, after going through many pre existing datasets we have decided to generate our own. First we have selected an location where we will be doing our deliveries so we have chosen "Bangalore" for that. We took the coordinates of the center location in Bangalore and decided to take 5 to 10 km radius map to perform our operations. We have created 2 separate files ordes_data and rider_data.
